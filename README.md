## YELP DATA ANALYSIS

This is a collection of analysis that I did on the Yelp datashet challenge (Fall 2017) as a project in my course Data Science and R. 
I used Apache Drill, Python, R and Tableau to perform analysis on this huge dataset.

## Three main tasks of the project:
1. Data Conversion : Converting the raw data to CSV format using Apache drill.
2. Visualization : Visualizing the extracted data using Tableau and R.
3. Models: Created Machine Learning model
